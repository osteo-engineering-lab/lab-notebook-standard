\section*{Introduction}	
All lab notebooks are legal documents, and property of Dean Lab. Notebooks should remain in the Biomedical Research Tower when not in use. In order to ensure they can be accurately referenced in the present and future, consistent formatting and labeling conventions are necessary. This document is intended to provide a complete guide to properly setting up and maintaining a lab notebook for Dean Lab.

\section{Numbering}

Every page of the lab notebook must be numbered in the upper right hand corner of the page. The first page containing an entry should be numbered '1.' Each page (note including back sides of pages) after that should be labeled 2, 3, 4... etc. through the end of the notebook. All pages before the pages with data entries should be labeled with lowercase roman numerals. 

\section{Table of Contents}

The first page of the lab notebook should be titled "Table of Contents." Entries regarding the same project or subject can be referenced in whole in this table. For example: if a mock sol fraction test was completed, the pages containing the protocol planning, data collection, observations and data analysis can all be recorded in this table as "Mock Sol Fraction Test." Any particularly important figures, data sets, or notes should also be distinguished in this table. Writing on the backs of pages is acceptable in this section.

\section{List of Abbreviations}

The second through fourth pages of the lab notebook should be reserved for defining any abbreviations used in the lab notebook. Abbreviating long or frequently used words can save time when writing in the lab notebook, but in any case that they are used, they must be clearly defined in this section. Even abbreviations that may seem obvious, such as 't' for 'time' should be explained here to avoid any possibility of confusion. When using abbreviations, ensure that no abbreviation is ever defined more than once. For example, 't' cannot be used to mean 'time' in some cases and 'temperature' in others. Writing on the backs of pages is acceptable in this section.


\section{Year}

The fifth page of the lab notebook should contain the year the notebook was started in. This is the only information that should appear on this page.

\section{Notebook Entries}

Each notebook entry should start with the date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. Below the date, any necessary information can be recorded neatly and clearly on the lines in the notebook. If a large amount of space in the notebook is left blank, there should be a note near the space indicating that it was intentional. In this section of the notebook, the backs of the pages should not be written on. This space is reserved for any comments added at a later time. If an entry continues over onto a new page in the notebook, "Continued" should be written at the top of the new page. At the end of each entry, a horizontal line should be drawn and signed on.
